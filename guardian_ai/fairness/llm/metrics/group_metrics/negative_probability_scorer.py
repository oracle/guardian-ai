class NegativeProbabilityScorer:
    """
    A scorer that estimates the probability of at least one score exceeding a predefined threshold.

    This scorer is useful for determining the likelihood of generating at least one "negative" or
    undesired output within a set of scores.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : float, optional
        The threshold above which a score is considered "negative".
        Defaults to 0.5.

        Computes the probability of occurrence of at least one score exceeding the predefined threshold.

        Parameters
        ----------
        classification_scores : List[List[float]]
            A list of lists, where each inner list contains scores obtained from a classifier
            corresponding to multiple independent completions of the same prompt.
